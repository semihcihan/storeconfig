# Project Context: App Store Sync CLI

This is a Node.js CLI tool for synchronizing in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions with the Apple App Store Connect API from a local JSON file.

## Key Information

- **Technology Stack:**

  - Runtime: Node.js
  - Libraries: `jsonwebtoken`, `axios`, `yargs`, `dotenv`. We will use `yargs` for the CLI interface.

- **Authentication:**

  - Uses JWT tokens generated from a private key (`.p8`), Key ID, and Issuer ID.
  - Configuration is managed via a `.env` file with `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_KEY_ID`, and `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`.

- **Core Functionality:**

  - The tool will sync IAPs and subscriptions based on a local JSON file.
  - It supports creating, updating, and deleting these items.
  - It includes commands for:
    - `app-store-sync init`: Creates a sample `iaps.json` file.
    - `app-store-sync validate --file <path>`: Validates the JSON file.
    - `app-store-sync plan --file <path>`: Shows a plan of changes (dry run).
    - `app-store-sync apply --file <path>`: Applies the changes to App Store Connect.

- **Development Plan:**
  - The development will follow the plan in `Project.md`. We are at the beginning of this plan.
  - The next step is to set up the project.

## References and Examples

- **Example and Schema:**

  - Refer to `@example.json` for a sample structure of the IAPs and subscriptions file.
  - The `@iap_subscription_openapi.json` file contains the OpenAPI specification for the App Store Connect IAP and Subscriptions API. This is a subset, may have missing data. When you can't find what you are looking for as API specifications, you should refer to the docs linked to cursor which is also given below `Managing In-App Purchases`.
