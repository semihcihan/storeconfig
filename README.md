## üîß Setup

### 1. Sign Up & Get Secret Key

First, sign up at [www.storeconfig.com](https://www.storeconfig.com) to get your Secret Key.

### 2. Authentication

Set up your App Store Connect API credentials:

```bash
# Configure StoreConfig with the StoreConfig Secret Key
storeconfig auth configure

# Configure Apple credentials
# See below for how to get the key and IDs.
storeconfig auth apple \
  --issuer-id YOUR_ISSUER_ID \
  --key-id YOUR_KEY_ID \
  --key-path /path/to/your/AuthKey_XXXXX.p8
```

#### Get App Store Connect Key and IDs

This is required for store config to manage your apps on App Store Connect.

1. **Open App Store Connect API Settings**

   - Go to [https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api)
   - Make sure the correct team is selected on top right corner of the page

2. **Create a New Team Key**

   - Click the "Plus" button to create a new `Team Key` (Not Individual Key)
   - Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "StoreConfig") to easily identify it later

3. **Set Required Permissions**

   - Select **App Manager Access** - this is required to manage prices and other app configurations

4. **Download and Copy Credentials**
   - Download the `.p8` file. This is the `--key-path` for the `auth apple` command.
   - **Key ID** is the `--key-id` for the `auth apple` command.
   - **Issuer ID** is the `--issuer-id` for the `auth apple` command.

## üìã Commands

### Tool Limitations

Due to current App Store Connect API restrictions, some features are not yet available in the CLI. As soon as these capabilities are supported by the API, we will update the CLI accordingly.

- **Creating a New App**: New apps can only be created via the App Store Connect website.
- **App Privacy**: App Privacy data can only be created or updated through the App Store Connect website. This process is repetitive, and we plan to add support once the API allows it.
- **State Management**: Submitting apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions is not supported. These actions are usually performed as a final step and are not repetitive or particularly difficult to do manually.
- **Age Rating**: Setting age ratings for apps is not currently supported.
- **Start and End Dates**: Setting start and end dates for in-app purchases and subscriptions is not supported.
- **Promo Offers**: Promo offers for subscriptions are not supported.
- **Billing Grace Period**: Billing grace period for subscriptions is not supported.

### Planned Features

- **App Category**: Support for setting app categories will be added soon.
- **Content Rights**: Support for managing content rights will be added soon.
- **iOS Platform**: Currently, only the iOS platform is supported. We plan to add support for additional platforms in the future.

### Security

- StoreConfig Secret Keys are stored in your local machine
- Apple credentials and key are securely sent and stored on our servers for app management purposes. You can revoke access at any time through Apple or use the `auth delete` command to remove them from our servers.

## Support

- üìö [Documentation](https://www.storeconfig.com/docs)
- üêõ [Report Issues](https://github.com/semihcihan/storeconfig/issues)

This CLI is proprietary software. Usage requires a valid subscription and Secret Key from [StoreConfig](https://www.storeconfig.com).
