## üîß Setup

### 1. Sign Up & Get API Key

First, sign up at [www.storeconfig.com](https://www.storeconfig.com) to get your API key.

### 2. Authentication

Set up your App Store Connect API credentials:

```bash
# Login with your API key
storeconfig auth login

# Configure Apple
# See below for how to get the key and IDs.
storeconfig auth apple \
  --issuer-id YOUR_ISSUER_ID \
  --key-id YOUR_KEY_ID \
  --key-path /path/to/your/AuthKey_XXXXX.p8
```

#### Get App Store Connect Key and IDs

This is required for store config to manage your apps on App Store Connect.

1. **Open App Store Connect API Settings**

   - Go to [https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api)
   - Make sure the correct team is selected on top right corner of the page

2. **Create a New Team Key**

   - Click the "Plus" button to create a new `Team Key` (Not Individual Key)
   - Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "StoreConfig") to easily identify it later

3. **Set Required Permissions**

   - Select **App Manager Access** - this is required to manage prices and other app configurations

4. **Download and Copy Credentials**
   - Download the `.p8` file. This is the `--key-path` for the `auth apple` command.
   - **Key ID** is the `--key-id` for the `auth apple` command.
   - **Issuer ID** is the `--issuer-id` for the `auth apple` command.

## üìã Commands

## üö® Important Notes

### API Limitations

There are some limitations with the App Store Connect APIs. When these are supported, we will update the CLI to support them too.

- **Creating a New App**: You can only create a new app through the App Store Connect website.
- **App Privacy**: You can only create/update App Privacy data through the App Store Connect website. This is a very repetitive work and we will add support for it in the future when it is supported by the API.
- **State Management**: We don't support submitting apps, in-app-purchases, subscriptions etc. This is usually the last step of the process and is not repetitive nor hard to do manually.

### Security

- StoreConfig API keys are stored in your local machine
- Apple credentials and keys are securely sent and stored on our servers for app management purposes. You can revoke access at any time through Apple or use the `auth logout` command to remove them from our servers.
