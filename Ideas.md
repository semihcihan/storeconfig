## IDEAS TODOs

- Have system defined and user defined territory groups and let these to be used
- billing grace period
- Schema version
- 500 errors may happen
- fetchAndMapIAPPrices still mentions USA, it should not do that. If base territory doesn't exist, it means that resource hasn't been created yet (which is fine since it may be a new app).

so in app purchases might not exist
or an in app purchase might exist but maybe it doesn't have any availability and or localizations and or priceSchedule

- filtering is available on stuff with states, like in app purchases etc
- The familySharable field is editable only for auto-renewable subscriptions and non-consumable in-app purchases.
- add jitter for retry
